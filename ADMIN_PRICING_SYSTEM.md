# Admin-Controlled Initial Pricing System

## Overview
This system allows administrators to review and control the initial pricing of prediction markets before they go live.

## How It Works

### 1. Market Creation Process
1. **User Proposes Market**: Users create markets with their suggested initial price
2. **Admin Review**: Markets go into a pending state requiring admin approval
3. **Price Adjustment**: Admins can adjust the initial price during review
4. **Approval/Rejection**: Admins approve markets (with or without price changes) or reject them

### 2. Smart Contract Functions Required

To implement this system fully, the following functions need to be added to the smart contract:

```solidity
// Market approval system
mapping(uint256 => bool) public marketApproved;
mapping(uint256 => bool) public marketPending;

function approveMarket(uint256 _marketId) external onlyOwner {
    marketApproved[_marketId] = true;
    marketPending[_marketId] = false;
}

function rejectMarket(uint256 _marketId) external onlyOwner {
    marketPending[_marketId] = false;
    // Refund creation fee to creator
}

function updateMarketPrice(uint256 _marketId, uint256 _newPrice) external onlyOwner {
    require(marketPending[_marketId], "Market not pending");
    markets[_marketId].initialPrice = _newPrice;
}

// Modify existing functions to check approval
modifier onlyApprovedMarkets(uint256 _marketId) {
    require(marketApproved[_marketId], "Market not approved");
    _;
}
```

### 3. User Interface Components

#### Create Market Page (`/app/create/page.tsx`)
- Modified to show admin approval notice
